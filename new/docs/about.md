We are the Bruinbots #13599, a group made up of 7 team members and 4 team coaches. We compete in the First Tech Challenge! The team is in its 8th season for FTC. We meet for 5 hours a week, 3 hours on Sundays, 2 hours on Tuesdays. We have lots of fun learning new things about building and programming robots. Coming from different schools, our members range from 7th-12th grade. Together we compete as the Bruinbots!
