  <h2 class="bruinbots-subtitle" id="rules">Rules</h2>
  <p class="bruinbots-paragraph">There are four robots on the field. Two on the red team and two on the blue team. The game is separated into a 30 second autonomous period and a 2 minute person operated period. In the autonomous period, robots can gain points by parting in an area denoted by a cone sleeve. Robots mainly gain points in the operated period for placing cones on the different sized junctions set up throughout the field.</p>

  <h2 class="bruinbots-subtitle" id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
  <p class="bruinbots-paragraph">Our strategy is to create an accurate, fast, and small robot. With this body style, we will be in a good position for putting cones on ground junction. Predictably, we will also get 10 penalty points when our opposing robots knock over our cones in the ground junctions because the cones are in their way. But the biggest advantage our robot has over other robots that is little and accurate and can evade the cones.</p>
