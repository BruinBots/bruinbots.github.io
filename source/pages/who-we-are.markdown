We are the Bruinbots #13599, a group made up of 11 team members and 3 team coaches. We compete in the First Tech Challenge! The team is in its 6th season for FTC. We meet for 5 hours a week, 3 hours on sundays, 2 hours on tuesdays. We have lots of fun learning new things about building and programming robots. Coming from different schools, our members range from 7th-11th grade. Together we compete as the Bruinbots!
